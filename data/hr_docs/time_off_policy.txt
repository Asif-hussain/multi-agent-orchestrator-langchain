Time Off and Leave Policy

Paid Time Off (PTO)

Our company provides a flexible PTO policy that combines vacation, sick leave, and personal days into one bank of time off.

PTO Accrual:
- 0-2 years of service: 15 days (120 hours) per year

- 6-10 years of service: 25 days (200 hours) per year
- 10+ years of service: 30 days (240 hours) per year

PTO accrues on a per-pay-period basis and is available for use as it accrues. New employees receive a pro-rated amount based on start date.

Maximum Accrual Cap:
- PTO accrual stops once you reach 1.5x your annual accrual amount
